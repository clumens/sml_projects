Requirements
============
The HTTP structure requires:

   - SML/NJ with CM, which should be included with any SML/NJ installation

   - My URI structure (http://www.bangmoney.org/projects/sml/URI), located
     in the ../uri directory relative to this source tree

I am not aware of any version-specific code being used in the structure
that requires a particular version of SML/NJ to be installed.  If you want
to be on the safe side, I have tested with version 110.48.


Installation
============
I'm not aware of any really good way to install add-on SML structures.
You can add the HTTP directory to your project by adding the following
line to the top section of your .cm file:

   library (path/to/http/http.cm)

And the following to the sources section:

   path/to/http/http.cm

This will cause CM to build the HTTP structure as part of your project and
autoload it.

Currently, the URI structure source directory is required to be at the
same directory level as this source tree.  I am working on a better way to
do this, hopefully in time for the 1.0 release.
