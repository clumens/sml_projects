About
=====
HTTP is a structure for working with the HTTP/1.0 protocol for Standard ML
of New Jersey (SML/NJ).  Its current functionality is limited to fetching
URIs from a web server.


Licensing
=========
It is licensed under a BSD style license in order to promote the use of
the code and SML in general.  See the top of any source file for the terms
of the license.


Usage
=====
See the included INSTALL file for how to install this library.  After
you've installed it, the structure is very easy to use.  See the signature
for the (currently) very simple API.  The most interesting function is
HTTP.get, which fetches URIs from a web server and writes out a file on
the filesystem.  The file written will be the name of the file provided in
the URI, or index.html if no filename is given.

   val get:  URI.URI -> HTTP.dl

The HTTP.dl type is a {filename: string, time: Time.time} record,
containing the full path of the output file and the amount of time it took
to download the URI.  If the web server returns an error condition, the
StatusCode exception is raised.

The rest of the API is currently pretty boring.

An example program for using HTTP is provided in the websuck subdirectory.
Websuck can be built into an almost standalone program by running make
from its subdirectory.  If you're not on x86 Linux, you will need to
modify the HEAP variable in the Makefile accordingly.
