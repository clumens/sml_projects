Requirements
============
The Ini structure requires SML/NJ with CM, the SML/NJ library, ML-yacc,
and ML-lex.  The first two should be built as part of any SML/NJ
installation, while the last two might not be included.  If you do not
have them, you will need to modify your installation to include these
build tools.  I am not aware of any version-specific code being used in
the structure that requires a particular version of SML/NJ to be
installed.  If you want to be on the safe side, I have tested with version
110.46.


Installation
============
I'm not aware of any really good way to install add-on SML structures.
You can add the ini directory to your project and then add a line like the
following to the bottom of your project's .cm file:

   library (path/to/ini/ini.cm)

And the following to the sources section:

   path/to/ini/ini.cm

This will cause CM to build the Ini structure as part of your project and
autoload it.
