Requirements
============
The URI structure requires SML/NJ with CM and the regular expression
library.  Both should be built as part of any SML/NJ installation.  I am
not aware of any version-specific code being used in the structure that
requires a particular version of SML/NJ to be installed.  If you want to
be on the safe side, I have tested with version 110.46.


Installation
============
I'm not aware of any really good way to install add-on SML structures.
You can add the uri directory to your project and then add a line like the
following to the bottom of your project's .cm file:

   path/to/uri/uri.cm

This will cause CM to build the URI structure as part of your project and
autoload it.
