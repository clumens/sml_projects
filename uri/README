of the license.


Usage
=====
See the included INSTALL file for how to install this library.  After
you've installed it, the structure is very easy to use.  See the signature
for the API.  Essentially, all the functions are built to either return or
operate on the URI.URI datatype.  This datatype has the ability to
represent several known types of URI, as well as a generic "unknown"
constructor to represent anything it doesn't yet understand in further
detail.

The parse function takes a string and returns a URI type:

   - URI.parse "http://www.bangmoney.org";
   val it =
     SOME
       (http
          {frag=NONE,host="www.bangmoney.org",password=NONE,path=NONE,port=NONE,
           query=NONE,user=NONE}) : URI.URI option

   - URI.parse "http://www.standardml.org/Basis/option.html#Option:STR:SPEC";
   val it =
     SOME
       (http
          {frag=SOME "Option:STR:SPEC",host="www.standardml.org",password=NONE,
           path=SOME "/Basis/option.html",port=NONE,query=NONE,user=NONE})
     : URI.URI option

   - URI.parse "asdf";
   val it = NONE : URI.URI option

The toString function should be familiar to anyone who's spent enough time
digging around the basis library.  It takes a URI type and returns a
string representation:

   - URI.toString (URI.ftp{host="ftp.kernel.org", password=NONE,
                   path=(SOME "/pub/linux/kernel"), port=NONE, user=NONE});
   val it = "ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel" : string

Note all the optional parts of the various URI.URI constructors.

Finally, URI provides the SchemeUnsupported exception.  This exception is
not thrown by any of the provided functions.  It's intended for use by
a function making use of URI, to let its caller know it was passed an
unsupported scheme.
