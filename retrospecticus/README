Requirements:
   Retrospecticus requires the cl_struct, mod_ml, and sml_sql projects to
   be installed and accessible.  They may be obtained from the same location
   you download Retrospecticus.


Source directory layout:
   icons/ - Artwork created for the Retrospecticus project.  These icons
            appear in the browser box and represent users and collections.
            You may choose between beach and space themes, by changing the
            icon_dir variable in src/config.sml.

            The icon sets were generously provided by Leah Riley.

   site/  - mod_ml pages which implement all the directly user-accessible
            portions of the photo browser.  Each file represents one web page.
            These files will be installed into a site-wite directory
            accessible by Apache, or into a user's public_html directory.

   sql/   - Scripts to be run in order to set up the databases.

   src/   - Retrospecticus backend.  Think of this as a library that the
            frontend uses to get the real work done.  These files interface
            with the filesystem and database.

   style/ - Stylesheets for the website, providing a consistent look.
