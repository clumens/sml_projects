About
=====
MD5 is a library for performing the MD5 message digest algorithm on files,
written for Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ).


Licensing
=========
It is licensed under the GPL due to the code being essentially a transcription
of the GNU md5sum program from coreutils into ML.  See the included COPYING
file for the terms of this license.


Usage
=====
See the included INSTALL file for how to install this library.  After you've
installed it, the structure is very easy to use.  See the signature for the
simple API.  The MD5.sum function takes in a filename and returns a string
of the MD5 message digest.
